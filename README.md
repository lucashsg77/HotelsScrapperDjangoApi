# HotelsScrapperDjangoApi
In order to use it just input your MongoDB User and Password into the setting.py file and do all the migration process, after that you can either input manually the hotels or you can scrape kayak first seacrh page with the scrapper, to do that just change the parameters to what you want into the scrapper.py file.
PS: the city has to be in IATA code, Los Angeles would be LAX, for example.
